The competition [I will look at is Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use).

The first place solution is by [Lennart Haupts](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/leaderboard)

The evaluation method is: [quadratic weighted kappa](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aroraaman/quadratic-kappa-metric-explained-in-5-simple-steps), which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters).

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```

This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $`\sqrt{\$4}`$

This sentence uses $\` and \`$ delimiters to show math inline: $`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2`$
